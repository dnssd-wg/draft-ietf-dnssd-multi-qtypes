QTYPE = A, QTn= MX, AAAA.\r\n\r\nAn NSEC or NSEC3 record is sent in order to prove that MX does not exist (e.g. MX).  The (misbehaving) server sends QTn = MX, AAAA in the answer.  It includes an NSEC record to prove that the MX does not exist.  It (erroneously or maliciously) does not include the AAAA record - a non-validating resolver sees this as a negative answer - a claim that the AAAA doesn't exist. But the NSEC record proves otherwise.",
