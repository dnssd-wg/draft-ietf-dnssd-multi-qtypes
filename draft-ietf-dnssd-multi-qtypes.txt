1.  Introduction

   A commonly requested DNS [RFC1035] feature is the ability to receive
   multiple related resource records (RRs) in a single DNS response.

   For example, it may be desirable to receive the A, AAAA and HTTPS
   records for a domain name together, rather than having to issue
   multiple queries.

   The DNS wire protocol in theory supported having multiple questions
   in a single packet, but in practise this does not work.  In
   [I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-qdcount-is-one], [RFC1035] is updated to only
   permit a single question in a QUERY (OpCode == 0) request.

   Sending QTYPE=ANY does not guarantee that all RRsets will be
   returned.  [RFC8482] specifies that responders may return a single
   RRset of their choosing.

   To mitigate these issues, this document constrains the problem to
   those cases where only the QTYPE varies by specifying a new option
   for the Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS [RFC6891]) that contains
   an additional list of QTYPE values that the client wishes to receive
   in addition to the single QTYPE appearing in the question section.  A
   second EDNS option is used in response packets as protection against
   DNS middleboxes that echo EDNS options verbatim.

   The specification described herein is applicable both for queries
   from a stub resolver to recursive servers, and from recursive
   resolvers to authoritative servers.

2.  Terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Description

3.1.  Multiple QTYPE EDNS Options Format

   The overall format of an EDNS option is shown for reference below,
   per [RFC6891], followed by the option specific data:

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   0: |                          OPTION-CODE                          |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   2: |                         OPTION-LENGTH                         |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   4: |                                                               |
      /                          OPTION-DATA                          /
      /                                                               /
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   OPTION-CODE: MQTYPE-Query (TBD1) in queries and MQTYPE-Response
   (TBD2) in responses.

   OPTION-LENGTH: Size (in octets) of OPTION-DATA.

   OPTION-DATA: Option specific, as below:

                   +0 (MSB)                            +1 (LSB)
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   0: |           QT1 (MSB)           |           QT1 (LSB)           |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   2: /              ...              |              ...              /
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      /           QTn (MSB)           |           QTn (LSB)           |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   QT: a (potentially empty) list of 2 byte fields (QTx) in network
   order (MSB first) each specifying a DNS RR type.  The RR types MUST
   be for real resource records, and MUST NOT refer to pseudo RR types
   such as "OPT", "IXFR", "TSIG", "*", etc.

3.2.  Server Response Generation

   A conforming server that receives an MQTYPE-Query option in a query
   MUST return an MQTYPE-Response option in its response.  The use of a
   secondary option code in responses serves as protection against DNS
   middleboxes that echo EDNS OPT Records verbatim.

   A server that receives an MQTYPE-Response option in a query MUST
   return a FORMERR response.

   On receipt of a valid MQTYPE-Query option the server SHOULD attempt
   to return any resource records known to it that match the additional
   (QNAME, QTx, QCLASS) tuples.  These records MUST be returned in the
   Answer Section of the response, but the answer for the primary QTYPE
   from the Question Section MUST be included first.

   If any invalid QTx is received in the query (e.g. one corresponding
   to a meta-RR) the server MUST return a FORMERR response.

   For any particular QTx in the query, if the server provides
   additional answers, or has knowledge that the RR type does not exist
   for that QNAME (a "negative answer"), it must include that QTx value
   in the Multiple QTYPE Option of its response.

   A negative answer is therefore indicated by the combination of the
   presence of a QTx value in the Multiple QTYPE Option and the absence
   of a matching record in the Answer Section.  This is necessary (in
   the absence of DNSSEC) to differentiate between absence of the record
   from the zone and absence of the record from the response.

   A server that is authoritative for the specified QNAME on receipt of
   a Multiple QTYPE Option MUST attempt to return all specified RR types
   except where that would result in truncation or a risk of a
   significant DNS amplification attack in which case it MAY omit some
   (or all) of the records for the additional RR types.  Those RR types
   MUST then also be omitted from the Multiple QTYPE Option in the
   response.

   A caching recursive server receiving a Multiple QTYPE Option query
   SHOULD attempt to fill its positive and negative caches with all of
   the specified RR types before returning its response to the client.
   It MAY limit itself to a smaller subset of the specified RR types if
   the processing overhead to fill its caches is too great or if there
   is a risk of a significant DNS amplification attack.

   While this document specifies no limit on the number of QTx values
   that may be specified, the author anticipates that server
   implementations will provide configuration settings to constrain the
   response sizes.

3.2.1.  DNSSEC

   If the DNS client sets the "DNSSEC OK" (DO) bit in the query then the
   server MUST also return the related DNSSEC records that would have
   been returned in a standalone query for the same QTYPE.

   A negative answer from a signed zone MUST contain the appropriate
   authenticated denial of existence records, per [RFC4034] and
   [RFC5155].

   In a signed zone there is a theoretical risk of valid signatures for
   one RR type and invalid signatures for another.  This is the only
   case known to the author where the response code for any particular
   QNAME may be inconsistent across different RR types.

   Should a validating resolver produce NOERROR for some RR types and
   SERVFAIL for others it MUST omit the RR types that failed to validate
   from its response and from the QTx fields on the Multiple QTYPE
   option.

3.3.  Client Response Processing

   Recursive resolvers MAY use this method to obtain multiple records
   from an authoritative server.  For the purposes of Section 5.4.1 of
   [RFC2181] any authoritative answers received MUST be ranked the same
   as the answer for the primary question.

   If the response to a query containing an MQTYPE-Query option does not
   contain an MQTYPE-Response option, or if it erroneously contains an
   MQTYPE-Query option, the client MUST treat the response as if this
   option is unsupported by the server and SHOULD process the response
   as normal.

   The client SHOULD subsequently initiate standalone queries (i.e.
   without using the MQTYPE-Query option) for any QTx value that did not
   generate a negative answer.

4.  Security Considerations

   The method documented here does not change any of the security
   properties of the DNS protocol itself.

   It should however be noted that this method does increase the
   potential amplification factor when the DNS protocol is used as a
   vector for a denial of service attack.

5.  IANA Considerations

   NB: to be rewritten once assignments have been made.

   IANA is requested to assign two new values (TBD1 and TBD2) in the DNS
   EDNS0 Option Codes registry for MQTYPE-Query and MQTYPE-Response.
   They should be consecutive, with the -Query option being an even
   number.
