# Introduction

A commonly requested DNS {{!RFC1035}} feature is the ability to receive
multiple related resource records (RRs) in a single DNS response.

For example, it may be desirable to receive both the A and AAAA
records for a domain name together, rather than having to issue
multiple queries.

The DNS wire protocol in theory supports having multiple questions in
a single packet, but in practise this does not work:

* Each question consists of the tuple (QNAME, QTYPE, QCLASS).  Since
each question has its own QNAME field it would be possible for one
name to exist and another to not exist, resulting in an
inconsistent response code.

* {{!RFC1035}} says that QDCOUNT is "usually 1" but the only documented
exceptions relate to the IQuery OpCode which was obsoleted in {{?RFC3425}}.
Other text in {{!RFC1035}} strongly implies a singular question.

* The idea that only a single question is allowed is sufficiently
entrenched that many DNS servers will simply return an error (or
fail to response at all) if they receive a query with a question
count (QDCOUNT) of more than one.

To mitigate these issues, this document constrains the problem to those
cases where only the QTYPE varies by specifying a new option for the
Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS {{!RFC6891}}) that contains an
additional list of QTYPE values that the client wishes to receive in
addition to the single QTYPE appearing in the question section.

TODO: why not "ANY" ?

# Terminology used in this document

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
{{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

# Description

## Multiple QTYPE EDNS Option Format

The overall format of an EDNS option is shown for reference below,
per {{!RFC6891}}, followed by the option specific data:

       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    0: |                          OPTION-CODE                          |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    2: |                         OPTION-LENGTH                         |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    4: |                                                               |
       /                          OPTION-DATA                          /
       /                                                               /
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

OPTION-CODE: TBD by IANA

OPTION-LENGTH: Size (in octets) of OPTION-DATA.

OPTION-DATA: Option specific, as below:

                    +0 (MSB)                            +1 (LSB)
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    0: |QTD|   reserved    |  QTCOUNT  |           QT1 (MSB)           |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    2: |           QT1 (LSB)           |              ...              |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
       |              ...             ///          QTn (MSB)           |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
       |           QTn (LSB)           |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

QTD: this bit indicates the direction of the packet.  It MUST be clear
(0) in a request and set (1) in a response.

QTCOUNT: a 3 bit field with range 0 .. 7 specifying the number of QT
fields to follow.  NB: Whilst the QTCOUNT could in theory be calculated
based on the OPTION-LENGTH field, having it explicitly specified ensures
a sensible constraint on its range of values.

QTn: a 2 byte field (MSB first) specifying a DNS RR type.  The RR type
MUST be for a real resource record, and MUST NOT refer to a pseudo RR
type such as "OPT", "IXFR", "TSIG", "*", etc.

## Response Generation

### Server Side Processing

A conforming server that receives a Multiple QTYPE Option in a query
MUST return a Multiple QTYPE Option in its response.

The QTD bit in that response MUST be set (1) as protection against
servers which simply echo unknown EDNS options verbatim.  If the QTD bit
in a response is zero the client MUST treat the response as if this
option is unsupported.

The server SHOULD attempt to return any resource records known to it
that match the additional (QNAME, QTn, QCLASS) tuples.  These records
MUST be returned in the Answer Section of the response, but the answer
for the primary QTYPE from the Question Section MUST be included first.

For any particular QTn in the query, if the server provides additional
answers, or has knowledge that the RR type type does not exist for that
QNAME (a "negative answer"), it must include that QTn value in the
Multiple QTYPE Option of its response.

A negative answer is therefore indicated by the combination of the
presence of a QTn value in the Multiple QTYPE Option and the absence of
a matching record in the Answer Section.  This is necessary (in the
absence of DNSSEC) to differentiate between absence of the record from
the zone and absence of the record from the response.

A server that is authoritative for the specified QNAME on receipt of a
Multiple QTYPE Option MUST attempt to return all specified RR types
except where that would result in truncation in which case it may omit
some (or all) of the records for the additional RR types.  Those RR
types MUST then also be omitted from the Multiple QTYPE Option in the
response.

A caching recursive server receiving a Multiple QTYPE Option SHOULD
attempt to fill its positive and negative caches with all of the
specified RR types before returning its response to the client.

TODO: is there a case for mandatory answers, i.e. the client saying I
_really_ want all these?

### Client Side Processing

Recursive resolvers MAY use this method to obtain multiple records from
an authoritative server.  For the purposes of Section 5.4.1 of
{{!RFC2181}} any authoritative answers received MUST be ranked the same
as the answer for the primary question.

### DNSSEC

If the DNS client sets the "DNSSEC OK" (DO) bit in the query then the
server MUST also return the related DNSSEC records that would have been
returned in a standalone query for the same QTYPE.

A negative answer from a signed zone MUST contain the appropriate
authenticated denial of existence records, per {{!RFC4034}} and
{{!RFC5155}}.

In a signed zone there is a theoretical risk of valid signatures for one
RR type and invalid signatures for another.  This is the only case known
to the author where the response code for any particular QNAME may be
inconsistent across different RR types.

Should a validating resolver produce NOERROR for some RR types and
SERVFAIL for others it MUST omit the RR types that failed to validate
from its response and from the QTn fields on the Multiple QTYPE option.
The client MAY then initiate standalone queries for those RR types.

# Security Considerations

The method documented here does not change any of the security
properties of the DNS protocol itself.

It should however be noted that this method does increase the potential
amplification factor when the DNS protocol is used as a vector for a
denial of service attack.

# IANA Considerations

IANA is requested to assign a new value in the DNS EDNS0 Option Codes
registry.
